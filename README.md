# Introduction to Machine and Deep Learning Theory
Materials of Lecture course provided in Winter/Spring 2023 in two largest Russia's Technical Universities:
* [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://www.msu.ru/en/) (Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics)
* [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology) (Master's program "Methods and technologies of artificial intelligence")

# Course overview
Deep learning is a young (approximate date of origin is 2011-2012), but actively developing area of machine learning, which is characterized primarily by the use of neural networks with a large (hence the word “_deep_” in the name) number of layers in their architecture. Initially, deep learning was a predominantly empirical field of knowledge in which new findings were primarily found experimentally. Subsequently, many findings began to receive theoretical justification, and somewhere theory is now even ahead of practice. The course will cover the basic concepts that are used in the theoretical consideration of empirical methods of machine and deep learning - the reasoning behind of loss functions, working with data distributions, theory of generative models, adversarial learning, stability of neural networks, and limit theorems.
